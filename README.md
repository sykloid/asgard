# sykloid/asgard

This repository holds the configuration files for `asgard.sykloid.org`, my
homelab deployment.

For anyone other than myself this repository is not going to be actionable.
However, hopefully it will have some educational value -- there are several
niche configuration options and conventions that might be of use to the next
enterprising operator.
